    - The whole interpreter redone
	  - Nigh-linear execution time
	  - No dependencies
	- Language semantics made more rigorous (execution order used to be quite
	  unpredictable)
	- Syntax changes (not backwards compatible)

0.1.3:
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed some serious bugs regarding naming function lists
    - (Hopefully) fixed all problems regarding implicit specification of rank
