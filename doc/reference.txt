# Function reference
### Adverbs
Adverbs take only one argument, which is an immediately following function, and return a new function.

 ~F    flips the arguments of the function. Informally: `x ~F y` is `y F x`
 /F    has two meanings, depending if it's called monadically or dyadically.
   /F y   applies F between all items of y. For example: `/+1 2 3` is `1+2+3`
   x /F y maps `x /F` to all items of y. For example: `1 2/+1 2 3` is `(1 2+1) (1 2+2) (1 2+3)`
 MF    is a shorthand for giving rank -1 -1 -1
 \F
   \F y   applies F to increasing subsets of y (0, 1, 2, 3... elements). Think of as scan.
   x \F y applies F to windows of y of width x

### Conjunctions
Conjunctions always take two arguments, where left argument either a literal or a function, and right argument is a function. They can return anything.

 r^F  gives a function, which calls F with rank r.
 v/,F gives a folding function, which has a preset starting value of v.
 F@G  gives a function, which passes the result of G to F. Informally: `x F@G y` is `F x G y`
 v@F  gives a function which uses F to select a function from v if v is a list. Has rank of F.
 F`G  gives a list with F and G. If F is a list, G is appended to it.
 F$G  when called monadically: (y F x G y)
                  dyadically:  (y F G y)
 F$,G when called monadically: ((x G y) F y)
                  dyadically:  ((G y) F y)

### Functions
x is always the left argument
y is always the right argument
