# Quick tutorial
#### Syntax reference
* Literals
  * Number: `10` or `5.3` or `.7`
  * Character: `'a`
  * String: `"a \"feather\""`
  * Lists: `1 2 3` - can contain any of the preceding literals and any expressions surrounded by braces.
* Function calls
  * Functions are referenced by `[A-W][a-z]*`
  * Functions always take two parameters, in the syntax `xFy`, where x is a literal immediately preceding the function and y is everything following it. The left and right argument are always referenced aw X and Y, respectively.
  * Modifiers take functions as their arguments and return new functions. They're referenced as A for adverb and C for conjunction.
    * `AF`
    * `vCF`, `FCF` (v is a literal argument to the conjunction)
